                        <p>One of the most distinctive features of traditional Indian food is spices. Indian cuisine is known for its bold and 
                            complex flavours due to the frequent use of spices, such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, ginger, and black pepper.
                             These spices add a one-of-a-kind taste and have health benefits, mainly anti-inflammatory and antioxidant.</p>
                        <p>Another important aspect of Indian food culture is the use of herbs. Fresh herbs, such as cilantro, mint, and parsley,
                             are commonly used in Indian dishes to add a burst of flavour and freshness. These herbs are also believed to have medicinal
                              properties and are often used in Ayurvedic medicine.</p>
                        <p>North Indian cuisine features dishes such as tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and palak paneer, while South Indian cuisine is known for its 
                            use of rice, lentils, and coconut in dishes like dosa and sambar. On the other hand, East Indian cuisine is characterised by 
                            its use of mustard oil and fish, and West Indian cuisine is known for its use of seafood and coconut milk.</p>

                        <h2>KASHMIR'S BEAUTIFUL WEATHER</h2>
                        <p class="meta">Posted on February 18, 2025 by Mohan Balaji</p>
                        <p>The best time to visit in Jammu and Kashmir is from April to October. During this time, the weather is pleasant, 
                            and the valley is blooming with a variety of flowers. Summer is the peak tourist season in this state, and the 
                            temperature is mild and pleasant. July and August are the months for the annual Amarnath Yatra.</p>
                        <p>The summer season begins in March and lasts until the beginning of June. It is the best time to visit Kashmir because
                             the climate is ideal for sightseeing; it is neither too hot nor too cold. The temperature during the day ranges 
                             from 15 °C to 30 °C.</p>

                        <h2>MALDIVES SERENE</h2>
                        <p class="meta">Posted on February 02, 2025 by Mohan Balaji</p>
                        <P>With 26 atolls and 1,000+ islands spread out across the idyllic waters of the Indian Ocean, the Maldives
                             are an island-hopper’s dream. Below the water, there’s miles of coral reef that are home to thousands
                              of species of marine life and underwater treasures. 
                        <P>To get the best of it: Go diving at Broken Rock,
                               snorkel with manta rays in Hanifaru Bay, or charter a boat to hit all the top spots. Then there’s 
                               the world above, which is known for its beautiful beaches and luxury villas, but has a rich culture 
                               and history to uncover as well: Explore the 17th-century architecture of the Old Friday Mosque or 
                               get a taste of local life (and some of the islands’ freshest seafood) at the Fish Market in Malé. 
                               It doesn’t stop there—we’ve got more hidden gems and must-do’s below.</P>
